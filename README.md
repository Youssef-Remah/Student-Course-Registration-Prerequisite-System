					Student Course Registration Prerequisite Checking System


This repository contains the console and GUI version in their files respectively which are:
- GUI207.exe
- CSCI207Project.exe

Description:
This project requires the use of a 2-child tree data structure to store different courses and their prerequisites.
Based on this list, a student may or may not take a specific course.

Basic Idea:
This program will input the university course list with their prerequisites ONCE at the start of program by reading this information from a file.
Then, whenever a student is willing to register a number of courses, he/she will enter the courses they studied and the ones they want to register in.
The system will allow or disallow the student from registering the course based on stored course prerequisites.

The project is implemented in C++. This project has two versions, a console based one and the other is a GUI.

Authors:
A team at the university developed this project, which served as a deliverable for a university course.
